# FaceDetection-AI-JS
An application which can detect face using AI techniques to recognize image. It uses face-api.js and different behavior models to detect the face and tell the expression of the face.

1. Used face-api.js from this AI face recognization api, https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js
2. Used different expression models from here, https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/Face-Detection-JavaScript/tree/master/models
